# Fear's Maps

This is an in-progress mappack for HWRM.

Most of these maps focus on unusual map elements, such as debris, radiation and pre-placed units, as well as more scattered and symmetric ru placement.

## Install

Simply copy and paste the `Data` folder over the `Data` folder found in `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Homeworld\HomeworldRM`.

**This will not erase any files except previous installs of this same mappack.**

Other maps etc. will be untouched.

That's it!
